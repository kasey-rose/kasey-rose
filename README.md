# Kasey Turtell
## Binghamton University, May 2025

I'm currently a senior at Binghamton University, pursuing my Bachelors degree in **Mathematics**, on the Actuarial Science track, with a minor in **Digital and Data Studies**. I have a deep passion for mathematics, data visualization, and analytics, and I have developed a solid foundation in the technical skills required to tackle complex data problems. I'm always seeking new experiences and exposure to what I haven't seen before, and I'm excited to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. My primary interest lies in **data analytics**, where I thrive in challenging environments and continuously strive to adapt, learn, and grow in fast-paced, dynamic settings.
